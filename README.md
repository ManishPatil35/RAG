# RAG
Regenerative Augmented Generation

•	Developed a Flask application that utilizes the transformers library for advanced text generation, leveraging the T5 model and tokenizer for conditional generation tasks.

•	Implemented a custom web scraper using Postman API to fetch and pre-process data from web pages or links, ensuring accurate data extraction and handling.

•	Designed a robust backend system for question-answering functionality:

o	Loaded context data from a text file, split it into manageable chunks, and utilized TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to retrieve the most relevant chunks.

o	Constructed a comprehensive response by integrating the most pertinent context chunks and generating detailed answers using a text generation pipeline.


•	Set up detailed logging to facilitate debugging and ensure smooth operation of the application
